<h1>About Me</h1>

   I am motivated to seek an innovative and non-standard approach to solving emerging cases.</p>

acquired my beginning skills. After that I went to High school of Mathematics and natural sciences to follow up on Informatics. Currently I am
studying Computer Science at the Technical university of Sofia.</p>
